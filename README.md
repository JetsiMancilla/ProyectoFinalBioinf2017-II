## README

In this repository are found the necessary data to carry out a de novo sequencing of the sequences of seven housekeeping genes of 69 bacterial strains. This repository contains the following folders:

- **data** : In this subdirectory there is a folder called "Acinetobacter baumannii Database"; which contains the clinical data of each of the strains that were used in this study. Furthermore, there is a folder called "Crude Data", where the data is in FASTQ format. The "Processed data" folder contains the analyzes that were carried out to determine the quality of the sequences; also, there is a file in excel format, which shows the results of the analysis of the quality of the sequences.

- **bin** : This subdirectory contains the necessary scripts to analyze the sequences; that is, it describes how the analysis of the quality of the sequences was carried out; the scripts necessary to carry out the assembly of sequences and the evaluation of the assembly are also shown.
